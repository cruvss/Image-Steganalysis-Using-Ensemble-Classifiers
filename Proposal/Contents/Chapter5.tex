\section{Software Requirement}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Python:} 
Python is a versatile programming language commonly used for developing software applications. It can be used for various tasks in the system, such as backend development, data processing, and machine learning integration.
\item \textbf{MongoDB:}
MongoDB is a widely used NoSQL database, utilizes JSON-like documents for data storage, ensuring excellent performance and scalability. Its schema-less structure supports dynamic data modeling, making it well-suited for web applications. By employing collections instead of conventional tables and incorporating horizontal scaling, MongoDB efficiently handles diverse data types across multiple servers. This versatility positions it as a robust solution for contemporary, data-driven environments.
\item \textbf{React }
 React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly in single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, it uses a declarative approach for efficiently updating the DOM. With a component-based structure, React enhances modularity and reusability, making it a popular choice for creating interactive and scalable web applications.
\item \textbf{Javascript:}
JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for developing web-based applications. It can be used for front-end development, implementing interactive features on the systemâ€™s web interface, and facilitating communication with the backend. 
\item \textbf{Tensorflow: }
TensorFlow is an open-source machine-learning framework that provides a wide range of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine-learning models. It can be used for image recognition, object detection, and prediction algorithms in the Smart Parking Management System.
\item \textbf{Keras:}
Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python. It can be used as a user-friendly interface to TensorFlow, simplifying the process of designing and training deep learning models for tasks like number plate recognition or image analysis in the system.
\item \textbf{VS Code:}
VS Code is a popular and widely used source code editor that offers a range of features and extensions to enhance the development experience. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and React, making it suitable for working with the different components of the system.
