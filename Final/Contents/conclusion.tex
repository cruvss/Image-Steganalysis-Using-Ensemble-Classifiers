\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
The project aimed to detect steganographically modified JPEG images using Ensemble Classifier, irrespective of the steganographic algorithm was successful in achieving the objectives. Throughout our image steganalysis project, our main aim was to create a strong Ensemble Classifier that could find hidden messages in JPEG images. As we worked through the complexities of image processing and machine learning, we faced many challenges and learned a lot along the way.

One of the most important things we learned was k ho? k ho?  how to understand and read research papers. We also learned how teamwork is really important. By working together and helping each other out, we were able to solve tough problems and make our project even better. Even though we faced some diffuculites, we came out of this project with a ton of knowledge and experience. This project not only helped us get better at programming stuff[milcha yo?] but also taught us how to work together as a team. We are really proud of what we have accomplished and we hope that our project will be useful to others as well.
Future Enhancements:
implement it as google extension to detect steganography in images while browsing the internet.
implement the feature extraction process in python to make it more efficient.
Use other more vast dataset to train the model.
