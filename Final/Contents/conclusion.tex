\chapter{Conclusion}
The project's goals of using Ensemble Classifier to identify JPEG images altered through steganography were successfully met. Our major goal was to develop a powerful Ensemble Classifier that could identify hidden messages in JPEG images throughout the course of our image steganalysis research. We encountered numerous difficulties and gained a great deal of knowledge as we navigated the complexity of image processing and machine learning. Gaining the ability to understand and interpret research papers was one of the most essential lessons we took away. The field of steganalysis is very vast but there is very little progress seen on universal steganalysis , this project aims to further empower the research on universal steganalysis.\\
In conclusion, the project of steganalysis using ensemble classifier is completed successfully as it was able to properly detect steganographically modified images accurately
