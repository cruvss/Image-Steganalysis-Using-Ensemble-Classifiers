\chapter{Conclusion}
The project aimed to detect steganographically modified JPEG images using Ensemble Classifier was successful in achieving its objectives. Throughout our image steganalysis project, our main aim was to create a strong Ensemble Classifier that could find hidden messages in JPEG images. As we worked through the complexities of image processing and machine learning, we faced many challenges and learned a lot along the way. One of the most important things we learned was learning the skill of comprehending and interpreting research papers. We also learned how teamwork is really important. By working together and helping each other out, we were able to solve tough problems and make our project even better. Even though we faced some diffuculites, we came out of this project with a ton of knowledge and experience. This project not only helped us get better at programming stuff but also taught us how to work together as a team.\\
In conclusion, the project of steganalysis using ensemble classifier is completed \mbox{successfully} as it was able to properly detect steganographically modified images accurately.
