\section{Dataset Preparation}
After the selection of our Dataset which is IStego100K\cite{7}, now we need to further process this dataset. It was not feasible to train the model using all data at once. So, Initially we splitted the dataset into different batches. Each batch consisting of 40,000 images (20000 cover images and 20000 stego images). We tried to train the model using this subset of datset but there was mermory Limitation problem. We then reduced the batch size to 30,000 (15,000 cover images and 15,000 stego images), but still faced the same issue. Finally, we set the batch size to 20,000 (10,000 cover and 10,000 stego), which allowed the training process to proceed successfully. To split the dataset, we utilized a Microsoft PowerShell script, which splitted the dataset into the desired subsets and stored them in respective subfolders.\\
\section{Trainig the Ensemble Model}
Before training the model, it was necessary to identify the most suitable features for our project. Therefore, we conducted several tests to determine the optimal feature set for training our model.
\subsection{DCTR Feature}
Initially, we used (DCTR) features with a feature dimensionality of 8000 for training our model. However, we faced several challenges: the feature extraction process was time-consuming, and the outcomes were unsatisfactory.\\

\begin{flushleft}
Using DCTR as feacture vector for trainig the model we got Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.59 which is quite low. We tried using different sub-set of data set but result was still same. Above graphs shows ROC curve, OOB error vs number of base learner, confusion matrix and histogram of votes.

\subsection{CC-CN Feature}
Later on, we came across cc-cN features, specifically cc-c300, which provided a higher dimensionality of 48600. These features proved to be more effective in capturing dependencies among individual cover elements. Due to the large dimensionality of our images, we used for Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) as the base learner for our ensemble classifier. As a result, we observed improved performance compared to our earlier one.\\

Upon using different sub-set of datasets the result was still same. The OOB error was minimum when number of base learners was 160.
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{CC-CHEN Feature}
We looked into another feature extraction method called cc-chen, which had 972 dimensions, to see if it was better than cc-c300. However, the results weren't as good as with cc-c300. So, we decided that cc-c300 was the best choice for our project.\\

The ROC curve, OOB error vs number of base learner, confusion matrix and histogram of votes are shown in the above graphs. The OOB error was minimum when number of base learner was 120. In this process we made sub space dimensionality constant of 800 while number of base learner to automatically get selected when OOB error was minimum.

\section{Discussion}
The decision between MATLAB and Python as our primary platform was influenced by the availability of feature extraction tools. Since our feature extraction process was exclusive to MATLAB, we were inclined to use MATLAB. Although the functionality to call and use python engine inside MATLAB was available but there were limitations to their usage as there were version compatibility issues. For the functionality of using python in MATLAB we required matlabengine which had various bugs and they have various version compatibility issues as well.\\
There were also various procedure which had to be carefully followed in order to properly execute python libraries using matlabengine. 
Thus, although it was possible to call MATLAB functions from Python, limitations such as version compatibility and slower execution using MATLAB Engine prompted us to stick with MATLAB for feature extraction.\\
For the creation of the demos, there were functionalities to create web based demo using MATLAB as backend with help of FLASK but it required matlabengine which had  various compatibility issues as mentioned before. So, we decided to use MATLAB's matlab app designer functionality for creating a demo app without the need of matlabengine.
% In assessing classification methods, we experimented with using a Random Forest ensemble classifier in Python. The model's performance and accuracy closely matched those obtained using MATLAB.\\

The following are the findings or results obtained from the selected model:
\subsection{Time requirements}
Table below shows the different time requirements for our project:

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    S.N                & Average Time Required \\ \hline
    Feature Extratoion & 0.8 second per Image            \\ \hline
    Model Training with 20,000 images  & 10 minutes            \\ \hline

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Time Requirements}
    \end{table}
\subsection{ROC Curve}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{./img/2600/roc2600.jpg}
    \caption{ROC Curve}
\end{figure}
The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. It is often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity and the specificity of the model. The AUC is the area under the ROC curve. The higher the AUC, the better the performance of the model at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\\
We obtained Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.7116, indicating a high level of classification between positive and negative instances
\subsection{OOB versus Number of Base Learners}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{./img/2600/staturAATE2600.jpg}
    \caption{OOB vs Number of Base Learners}
\end{figure}
Above graph shows different values of OOB error for different number of base learners. It is observed that the OOB error decreases as the number of base learners increases. The OOB error is minimum when the number of base learners is 160.
\subsection{Confusion Matrix}
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{./img/2600/consuse2600.jpg}
\end{figure}
\caption{Confusion Matrix}
\end{table}
The model's classification performance is summarized through a confusion matrix, featuring 3627 true positives (correctly identified positives), 2923 false negatives (misclassified negatives), 2077 false positives (incorrectly labeled positives), and 1373 true negatives (correctly identified negatives). These metrics offer a concise yet comprehensive overview of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases, providing crucial insights for evaluating its effectiveness. The confusion matrix serves as a pivotal tool in assessing the model's strengths and weaknesses, contributing valuable information to the ongoing discourse on classification model refinement.
\subsection{Histogram}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{./img/2600/histo2600.jpg}
    \caption{Histogram of votes}
\end{figure}
The histogram of votes is a graphical representation of the number of votes for each class. The histogram provides a visual representation of the model's classification performance, offering insights into the distribution of votes across the different classes. The histogram is a valuable tool for evaluating the model's classification performance, providing a comprehensive overview of the distribution of votes and the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
