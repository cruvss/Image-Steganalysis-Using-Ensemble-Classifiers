\chapter{Limitations and Future Enhancements}
\subsection{Limitations}
These are some of the Limitations of our project that it currently faces:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item The system could only be trained on a small dataset because we faced limitations in accessing sufficient computational resources.
    \item The model has the ability to only detect steganography using three algorithms: nsF5, J-uniward, and UERD. It's optimized for detecting embedding rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 bits per pixel.
    \item The system is confined to MATLAB, which might not be widely familiar among users.
    \item The project is limited to JPEG images only. It does not support other image formats.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Enhancements}
Considering our current limitations, we have identified the following areas for future enhancements:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Optimize model training by efficiently utilizing the entire dataset while accommodating limited computational resources.
    \item Convert the existing code into Python format to enhance its versatility for implementation on various platforms.
    \item Develop a Google Chrome extension that employs a model for detecting steganographically altered images on the internet.
    \item Extend the model to support other image formats such as PNG, BMP, and TIFF.
\end{enumerate}
