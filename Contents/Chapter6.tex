\chapter{Expected Outcomes}
The proposed system is expected to detect stego images using ML model. It would be capable of decting hidden information with high accuracy. It is expected to be able to identify and optimize the extraction techniques to improve the sensitivity and specificity of steganalysis. The model will be able to adapt to emerging steganographic techniques and provide real-time dection capabilities.
