\chapter{Literature Review}
Some work has been done in image steganalysis. Various steganalysis tools use different approaches like feature extraction, shallow ML, and deep learning methods to detect stego images. This literature review seeks to portray the history, methodologies, implementation and applications of steganalysis.\\
Multiple research has been done to achieve excellent results in steganalysis. Krzysztof Szczypiorski et al.\cite{1} used deep learning and ensemble classifiers to detect image steganography using different methods like DCTR and shallow machine learning classifiers. They found that performance depended heavily on the steganographic method used and on the density of the embedded hidden data. Detection of the content hidden with the nsF5 algorithm at the density 0.4 bpnzac was almost perfect while detection of data hidden using J-Uniward at 0.1 bpnzac was hardly possible. It was also found that steganalysis done using shallow ML was better in comparison to deep learning.\\
The document titled "The Discrete Cosine Transform: Theory and Application" \cite{4} gave us comprehenisve overview of Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT) and its application in image and video processing. The document discusses the properties of the DCT, including its decorrelation characteristics, energy compaction, and its ability to reduce entropy. It highlights the DCT's role in efficient coding and compression, particularly in the context of image and video standards such as JPEG and MPEG. Additionally, The document addresses the inverse DCT operation and its impact on visual distortion, providing examples of reconstructed images at different quantization levels.\\
George Berg et al.\cite{2} proposed an ML approach to steganalysis. This paper shows the feasibility of using a machine learning and data mining (ML/DM) approach to automatically build a steganography attack. This paper used three common data mining and learning techniques: decision trees, error back-propagation, artificial neural networks and the naïve Bayes classifier, to identify messages hidden in compression- (JPEG) and contentbased (GIF) images.\\
Similarly, MT Hogan et al.\cite{3} evaluated the statistical limits by using probability density functions(pdfs). ML tests based on DC-DM are presented in this paper. \\
To effectively uncover hidden information in images, we need a steganalysis tool with sharp pattern recognition skills. Sometimes, when we compare images that have been manipulated with certain tools to their original versions, we can spot a few noticeable visual irregularities – like odd pixels or changes in dimensions due to cropping or padding. If an image doesn't fit specific size criteria, it might get cropped or padded, and you'll see black spaces. Interestingly, most manipulated images don't give away obvious clues when compared to their originals. The simplest clue is a size increase between the manipulated and original images. Other signatures show up in how the colors are arranged in the image, such as a significant change in the number of colors or a gradual increase or decrease. Grayscale images follow a different pattern, increasing incrementally. Another strong indicator is an unusual number of black shades in a grayscale image.\\
The document titled "Ensemble Classifiers for Steganalysis of Digital Media".\cite{5} highlights several key studies in the field of steganalysis, which provides a solid foundation for understanding the current state of steganalysis. The document discusses the implementation of SVM based stego image detection using support vector machines for classification and regression analysis. It outlines the proposed SVM neural network based steganalysis methods, particularly focusing on the SVM-Chen Classification Method. The performance of the stego image classifier is evaluated in terms of error rate, F-score, and precision, providing a detailed analysis of the classifier's effectiveness. The document concludes by highlighting the excellent performance of the proposed SVM-spam model in stego image detection, emphasizing its high accuracy and precision. This literature review offers a comprehensive analysis of image steganography techniques and the implementation of SVM-based steganalysis methods. \\                    
The document titled "A fast and accurate steganalysis using Ensemble classifiers".\cite{6} provides an in-depth insight into the use of an ensemble of classifier for steganalysis, with a focus on machine learning. The ensemble-based steganalyzer uses feature vectors from multiple steganalyzers to create a decision algorithm that allows the combination of information from different steganalyzers.The resulting steganalyzer is also inherently suitable for multi-class classification scenarios. The paper presents a novel steganalysis decision framework using hierarchical classifiers,which addresses the limitations of existing steganalysis methods and provides a scalable and cost-effective approach to steganalysis.
Ensemble classifiers are designed to overcome the limitations of individual classifiers by combining their outputs to achieve better performance. Steganalysis using ensemble classifiers is a powerful approach that utilizes the strength of multiple classifiers to help improve the detection of hidden information in images. It provides diverse steganographic techniques while also enhancing the overall accuracy. Ensemble classifiers are designed to overcome the limitations of individual classifiers by combining their outputs, thereby achieving better performance.\\
